1. Sorting Data
   -- Sort the table by sale_amount in descending order
   SELECT product_id, sale_amount, sale_date
   FROM sales
   ORDER BY sale_amount DESC;


2. Grouping and Aggregating Data


   --> To perform aggregations like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc., we can use the GROUP BY clause.

    SELECT product_id, SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY product_id;

   --> To find the average sales per region

    SELECT region, AVG(sale_amount) AS avg_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY region;

3. Combining Sorting and Aggregation

   SELECT region, SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales
   FROM sales 
   GROUP BY region
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
